# Synth Roll iOS

<br>

## Description

Synth Roll iOS is an extreme cyberpunk themed dice rolling application that allows users to roll three sets of synth-wave dice. The application is written entirely programmatically using only Swift and UIKit; without the use of storyboards.

Synth Roll iOS currently uses two ViewControllers with a transition/segue into one another using UINavigationController. Both ViewControllers contain views that are put together programmatically using only UIKit, specifically: UIImageViews, UIButtons and UIViews. The application attempts to follow the MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel) design pattern.
